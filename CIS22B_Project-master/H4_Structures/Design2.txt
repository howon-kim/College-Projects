Nested Structure
- Lowest , Highest can be nested structure


* Best style for pointer for structure

void printCollege (College *school)
{
cout << (*school).rank; // OK
cut << school -> rank; // BEST
}


* Structure use reference because if use pass by value use a lot of memory
ex. void ShowItem(const InventoryItem &p)
-> Pass by  reference but prevent to change the data

* Returning a Structure from a Function 
-> Way to return more than 2 values
