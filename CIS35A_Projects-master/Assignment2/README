Payroll Part2

Modify the Payroll Program application so it continues to request employee information 
until the user enters stop as the employee name. 
In addition, program the application to check that the hourly rate and number of hours worked are positive numbers. 
If either the hourly rate or the number of hours worked is not a positive value, 
the application should prompt the user to enter a positive amount.
