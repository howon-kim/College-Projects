Final Project

    The user enters test scores one at a time and then clicks the Enter Score button.
    For each entered score, the application adds one to the number of scores, calculates the average score,
    and determines what the best score is so far. 
    Then, it displays the number of scores, average score, and best score in the three disabled text fields.
    The user can click the Clear button to reset everything to zero.
    When the user closes the frame or clicks the Close button, the application exits.
