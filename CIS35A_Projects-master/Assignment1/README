Payroll Part1

Create a non-GUI-based Java application that calculates weekly pay for an employee. 
The application should display text that requests the user input the name of the employee, 
the hourly rate, and the number of hours worked for that week. 
The application should then print out the name of the employee and the weekly pay amount. 
In the printout, display the dollar symbol ($) to the left of the weekly pay amount and 
format the weekly pay amount to display currency.
